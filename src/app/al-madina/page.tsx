        <h1>MADINA Munawwarah is the second holiest city in Islam, located in Saudi Arabia. It is the burial place of the Prophet MUHAMMAD peace.be.upon.him and is home to the Prophet's Mosque Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, one of the largest and most important mosques in the world. The mosque contains the Prophet's tomb, making it a major site of religious significance for Muslims.
Medina holds historical importance as the city where the Prophet MUHAMMAD peace.be.uopn.him migrated to from Mecca in 622 CE, an event known as the Hijra, which marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar. The city was the center of the early Muslim community and played a key role in the spread of Islam. Unlike Mecca, where Muslims perform the Hajj pilgrimage, Medina is not a pilgrimage destination by itself, but millions of Muslims visit it each year to pay respects to the Prophet MUHAMMAD peace.be.upon.him and to pray at the Prophet's mosques.</h1>
