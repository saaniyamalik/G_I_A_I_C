It holds a special place in Islamic history because it was the first mosque built by the Prophet MUHAMMAD peace.be.upon.him and his companions after their migration Hijra from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE. The mosque was constructed on the site where the Prophet and his companions rested when they arrived in Medina.
