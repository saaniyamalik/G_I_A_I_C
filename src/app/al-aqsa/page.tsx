         <h1>Al-Aqsa Mosque is one of the holiest sites in Islam, located in the Old City of Jerusalem. It is a significant religious and historical landmark for Muslims and is part of a complex known as the Al-Haram al-Sharif the Noble Sanctuary, which also includes the Dome of the Rock.
The mosque itself is situated on the southern part of the sanctuary and is an essential place of worship for Muslims, particularly for those performing the ritual prayer. The mosque's full name is "Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa," which means "The Farthest Mosque," referencing the Islamic belief that the Prophet MUHAMMAD peace.be.upon.himascended to the heavens from this location during the Night Journey Isra and Mi'raj.
The mosque is an iconic symbol in the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with its significance and status being a central issue in the broader political discourse. It is important to note that Al-Aqsa is one of the three holiest sites in Islam, alongside Mecca and Medina.</h1>
