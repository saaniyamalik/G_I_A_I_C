        <h1>Makkah is a city in Saudi Arabia, regarded as the holiest site in Islam. It is the birthplace of the Prophet MUHAMMAD peace.be.upon.him and the site of the Masjid al-Haram the Grand Mosque, which houses the Kaaba, a sacred structure Muslims believe to have been built by Abraham and his son Ishmael. Every year, millions of Muslims travel to Mecca to perform the Hajj pilgrimage, a key religious duty required of all able-bodied Muslims at least once in their lifetime. Mecca is also a focal point for daily Muslim prayers, as all Muslims are required to face the Kaaba during their prayers, wherever they are in the world.</h1>
